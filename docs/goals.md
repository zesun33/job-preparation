# Job Preparation Goals

## Background
I am an Electrical Engineering PhD student researching ML hardware accelerators and efficient ML algorithms. My goal is to prepare for internships and new grad job offers in Computer Science (CS) and Machine Learning (ML) from FAANG and similar top-tier companies. Given my non-CS background, I need to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms from scratch while focusing on the hardware aspects of ML.

## Primary Goals
1. **Master NeetCode 150 or 250**: Complete the NeetCode problem sets to build a solid foundation in coding problems commonly asked in technical interviews.
2. **Learn Data Structures and Algorithms**: Start from the basics and progressively learn key concepts in data structures and algorithms to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
3. **Build Coding Interview Skills**: Enhance my ability to solve problems under time constraints and communicate solutions effectively during interviews.
4. **Practice Across Platforms**: Engage with multiple coding platforms such as NeetCode, LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, and Codeforces to diversify problem-solving skills and adapt to different problem styles.

## Approach
- **Starting Point**: Begin with NeetCode to learn concepts as I solve problems, using it as a structured entry point into coding interviews.
- **Learning Support**: Utilize Cursor IDE and AI agentic help to understand algorithms, problem statements, and code solutions deeply.
- **Language Preference**: Primarily use Python for coding due to familiarity, with the option to use C or C++ if necessary for specific problems or performance-critical tasks.

## Focus Area
Given my research background, I aim to leverage my expertise in ML hardware accelerators to stand out in interviews by connecting algorithmic solutions to hardware efficiency where applicable, especially for ML-related roles.

## Progress Tracking
I will document my progress in this folder, noting completed problems, learned concepts, and areas needing improvement to ensure a structured and measurable preparation journey.
