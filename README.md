## Structure
- **code/**: Weekly solution folders (`week01`–`week12`) generated from the 12-week plan. Place your `.py`, `.cpp`, etc. solutions here.
- **resources/**: Reference materials such as `neetcode_150.md` (full problem list).
- **docs/**: High-level documentation
  - `goals.md` – long-term objectives.
  - `schedule.md` – 12-week study schedule.
  - `progress_board.md` – week-by-week completion board.
- **logs/**: Personal reflections and metrics
  - `templates/` – reusable `daily_log_template.md` and `week_overview_template.md`.
  - Copy templates, rename them with the date/week, and fill them in.
## Workflow / Quick-Start
1. **Pick today’s problems** from `docs/schedule.md`.
2. Solve them in the corresponding `code/weekXX/` directory.
3. After each session, duplicate `logs/templates/daily_log_template.md`, complete it, and commit.
4. At week’s end, fill out a copy of `week_overview_template.md` and update counts in `docs/progress_board.md`.
5. Review weak areas and adjust upcoming weeks as needed.
