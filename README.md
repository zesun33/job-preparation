# Job Preparation for CS and ML Roles

## Overview
This repository tracks my end-to-end preparation for Computer Science (CS) and Machine Learning (ML) internships / new-grad roles at FAANG-level companies.  I’m an Electrical Engineering PhD student focused on ML hardware accelerators, so the goal is to build a solid software interviewing foundation while showcasing my hardware strengths.

## Objectives
- **Master NeetCode 150** (12-week schedule)
- Learn data structures & algorithms from scratch
- Sharpen coding-interview skills across platforms (NeetCode, LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, Codeforces)
- Leverage Cursor IDE + AI assistance for guided learning

## Tools and Languages
- **Primary:** Python (readability, speed of iteration)
- **Secondary:** C / C++ (performance-critical tasks)
- **Environment:** Cursor IDE with integrated AI agents

## Version Control
Git is used for all source & documentation.  Follow conventional commit messages (`docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`) and push frequently.

## Structure
- **code/**: Weekly solution folders (`week01`–`week12`) generated from the 12-week plan. Place your `.py`, `.cpp`, etc. solutions here.
- **resources/**: Reference materials such as `neetcode_150.md` (full problem list).
- **docs/**: High-level documentation
  - `goals.md` – long-term objectives.
  - `schedule.md` – 12-week study schedule.
  - `progress_board.md` – week-by-week completion board.
- **logs/**: Personal reflections and metrics
  - `templates/` – reusable `daily_log_template.md` and `week_overview_template.md`.
  - Copy templates, rename them with the date/week, and fill them in.
## Workflow / Quick-Start
1. **Pick today’s problems** from `docs/schedule.md`.
2. Solve them in the corresponding `code/weekXX/` directory.
3. After each session, duplicate `logs/templates/daily_log_template.md`, complete it, and commit.
4. At week’s end, fill out a copy of `week_overview_template.md` and update counts in `docs/progress_board.md`.
5. Review weak areas and adjust upcoming weeks as needed.
