# Job Preparation for CS and ML Roles

## Overview
This repository tracks my end-to-end preparation for Computer Science (CS) and Machine Learning (ML) internships / new-grad roles at FAANG-level companies.  I'm an Electrical Engineering PhD student focused on ML hardware accelerators, so the goal is to build a solid software interviewing foundation while showcasing my hardware strengths.

## Objectives
- **Master NeetCode 150** (12-week schedule)
- Learn data structures & algorithms from scratch
- Sharpen coding-interview skills across platforms (NeetCode, LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, Codeforces)
- Leverage Cursor IDE + AI assistance for guided learning

## Tools and Languages
- **Primary:** Python (readability, speed of iteration)
- **Secondary:** C / C++ (performance-critical tasks)
- **Environment:** Cursor IDE with integrated AI agents

## Version Control
Git is used for all source & documentation.  Follow conventional commit messages (`docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`) and push frequently.

## Structure
- **code/**: Organized coding solutions
  - **neetcode150/**: Weekly solution folders (`week01`–`week12`) for the NeetCode 150 problems
  - **test_problems/**: Additional practice problems organized by week
  - **practice/**: Miscellaneous coding practice
- **resources/**: Reference materials and detailed learning notes
  - `neetcode_150.md` – full problem list
  - `notes/` – comprehensive teaching notes for each problem solved
  - `teaching_prompt_template.md` – template for AI-assisted learning
- **docs/**: High-level documentation
  - `goals.md` – long-term objectives
  - `schedule.md` – 12-week study schedule
  - `progress_board.md` – week-by-week completion board
- **logs/**: Personal reflections and metrics
  - `templates/` – reusable `daily_log_template.md` and `week_overview_template.md`
  - Daily logs with problem-solving insights and time tracking

## Workflow / Quick-Start
1. **Pick today's problems** from `docs/schedule.md`
2. Solve NeetCode 150 problems in `code/neetcode150/weekXX/` directory
3. Solve additional practice problems in `code/test_problems/weekXX/` directory
4. Create detailed teaching notes in `resources/notes/` using the teaching template
5. After each session, update daily logs and commit progress
6. At week's end, update `docs/progress_board.md` and review weak areas
