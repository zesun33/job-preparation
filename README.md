# Job Preparation for CS and ML Roles

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my preparation for internships and new grad positions in Computer Science (CS) and Machine Learning (ML) at FAANG and similar top-tier companies. As an Electrical Engineering PhD student specializing in ML hardware accelerators and efficient ML algorithms, my focus will be on the hardware aspects of ML while building a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and coding interview skills.

## Objectives
- Master the NeetCode 150 or 250 problem set to build problem-solving skills.
- Learn data structures and algorithms from scratch, as I come from a non-CS background.
- Enhance coding interview skills through practice on platforms like NeetCode, LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, and Codeforces.
- Utilize Cursor IDE and AI assistance to understand algorithms, problems, and code.

## Structure
- **code/**: Contains practice code and solutions for various problems.
- **resources/**: Includes learning materials, tutorials, and references for data structures and algorithms.
- **docs/**: Documentation of goals and progress tracking.

## Tools and Languages
- Primary language: Python
- Secondary languages: C, C++ (used occasionally if needed)
- Development Environment: Cursor IDE with AI agentic support

## Version Control
This project uses Git for version control to track progress and manage changes effectively.
