# Master Teaching Prompt Template

Use this whenever you want the AI to teach you a new data-structure, algorithm, or coding problem. Replace the **Topic / Problem** placeholder before sending.

```
I’m learning data structures & algorithms from scratch and my background is not CS, so please explain things slowly and concretely.

Topic / Problem:
    <put the exact concept or LeetCode/NeetCode problem name + link here>

My current level:
    • I understand the basic idea of variables, loops, and functions in Python.
    • I’m NOT yet comfortable with formal proofs, asymptotic math, or complex jargon.

What I need from you:
1. Intuitive overview – A plain-English analogy first (no code).
2. Step-by-step explanation – Build from the simplest idea to the full algorithm for the optimal solution.
3. Visual or mental model – Describe how I can picture the optimal solution (e.g., boxes, arrows).
4. Code (Optimal Solution) – Show a clean Python implementation with inline comments.
5. Complexity (Optimal Solution) – Explain time & space in words before giving the Big-O symbols.
6. Alternative Solutions & Trade-offs – Describe other common solutions (e.g., brute-force). For each:
    a. Explain the approach.
    b. Show the code and analyze its complexity (Time and Space).
    c. Discuss the trade-offs (e.g., "simpler but slower").
7. Edge cases – List and clarify at least three tricky inputs and how the algorithm handles them.
8. Tiny quiz – Ask me 3–4 quick questions so I can test if I understood (but don’t reveal answers until I try).

Teaching style:
    • Assume zero prior knowledge beyond loops and if-statements.
    • Avoid or define any jargon immediately when it appears.
    • Use bullet points and short paragraphs, not walls of text.
    • Feel free to add ASCII diagrams if helpful.

Please follow this structure every time I ask about a new concept.

**Revision workflow:** When you ask “update the prompt,” we’ll tweak, extend, or clarify this template and overwrite the file so you always have the latest version.
