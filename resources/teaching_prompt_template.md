# Master Teaching Prompt Template

Use this whenever you want the AI to teach you a new data-structure, algorithm, or coding problem. Replace the **Topic / Problem** placeholder before sending.

```
I’m learning data structures & algorithms from scratch and my background is not CS, so please explain things slowly and concretely.

Topic / Problem:
    <put the exact concept or LeetCode/NeetCode problem name + link here>

My current level:
    • I understand the basic idea of variables, loops, and functions in Python.
    • I’m NOT yet comfortable with formal proofs, asymptotic math, or complex jargon.

What I need from you:
1. Intuitive overview – A plain-English analogy first (no code).
2. Step-by-step explanation – Build from the simplest idea to the full algorithm.
3. Visual or mental model – Describe how I can picture it (e.g., boxes, arrows).
4. Real code – Show a clean Python implementation with inline comments.
5. Complexity – Explain time & space in words before giving the Big-O symbols.
6. Edge cases – List and clarify at least three tricky inputs and how the algorithm handles them.
7. Variations & trade-offs – Briefly compare any alternative approaches and when to choose each.
8. Tiny quiz – Ask me 3–4 quick questions so I can test if I understood (but don’t reveal answers until I try).

Teaching style:
    • Assume zero prior knowledge beyond loops and if-statements.
    • Avoid or define any jargon immediately when it appears.
    • Use bullet points and short paragraphs, not walls of text.
    • Feel free to add ASCII diagrams if helpful.

Please follow this structure every time I ask about a new concept.

**Revision workflow:** When you ask “update the prompt,” we’ll tweak, extend, or clarify this template and overwrite the file so you always have the latest version.
