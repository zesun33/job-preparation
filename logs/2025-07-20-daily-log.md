## Problems Solved

- [x] Top K Frequent Elements (NeetCode 150 - Arrays & Hashing)

## Key Learnings / Insights

- Learned the bucket sort approach for an optimal O(n) time complexity solution.
- Understood the trade-offs between bucket sort (faster, more complex) and a simpler sorting-based solution (O(n log n)).
- Practiced using hash maps for frequency counting and a list of lists for bucketing.

## Next Focus
